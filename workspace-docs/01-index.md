# Electronic Monitoring Service

This site aims to provide a high level synopisis of the domain and system landscape that supports the Electronic Monitoring Service (EMS) and the wider organisational goals that EMS contributes to.
Additionally this site represents the teams shared working understanding of the existing technical architecture of the live service and captures the current efforts in supporting technical assurance to the EM programme.

## Finding our bearings

### Organisations and their Digital Strategies
As part of the [MoJ's strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ministry-of-justice-outcome-delivery-plan/ministry-of-justice-outcome-delivery-plan-2021-22#a-executive-summary) to deliver a world-class justice system that works for everyone in society. The [MoJ Digital Strategy](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1064860/moj-digital-strategy-2025.pdf) is to become a data driven and user led organisation. The MoJ sponsors [HM Prison and Probation Service (HMPPS)](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-prison-and-probation-service/about) to carry out sentences given by the courts, in custody and the community, and rehabilitate people in their care through education and employment.

HMPPS have a [digital data and technology strategy](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hmpps-digital-data-and-technology-strategy-what-to-expect-in-202122/hmpps-digital-data-technology-strategy-what-to-expect-in-202122). One aspect of that strategy has become the mission statement for the Electronic Montioring product team:
"Develop simpler, clearer and faster services for prisoners, people on probation and those that supervise them."

[Justice Digital](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/about/) are currently working with the Electronic Monitoring Service to:
- Provide technical advice and assurance on live service provision
- Support the reprocurement of the EM outsourced service which will implement a new service design, new technology and improve interfaces between the MOJ and external providers
- Support the transition from old supplier to new supplier in a safe and proportionate way including data migration
- Bring in additional digital and technical skills to support the overall programme

The full Electronic Monitoring Strategy can be found [here](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1086639/em-strategy.pdf).
In summary the strategy is to "Strengthen the electronic monitoring offer and unlock the potential of electronic monitoring within the criminal justice system".
Which will be achieved by:
- Integrating electronic monitoring more firmly into offender management
- Introducing, testing, and evaluating new uses of electronic monitoring
- Building electronic monitoring capability and confidence

The strategies are strongly aligned and digital transformation is viewed as an enabler where digital systems are key to success in order to expand and react to the domain.

### The role of the service
Build trust and confidence in community supervision in order to reduce reoffending and protect the public.

### Service history
The Electronic Monitoring Service has had a rocky history, a damning summary from a parliament publication relating to the failed launch of project 'Gemini' which aimed to bring in new services to drive EM can be found [here](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/30446/documents/175605/default/)

"HM Prison & Probation Service’s (HMPPS) transformation programme for electronic monitoring (‘tagging’) has failed to transform the service as intended. HMPPS launched the programme to improve efficiency and increase the usefulness of tagging for police and probation services, but after significant setbacks and delays the failure has cost taxpayers dear. Its high-risk and over-complicated delivery model, poor oversight of suppliers, overambitious timetable and light-touch scrutiny from the Ministry of Justice all contributed to its failure to introduce a new case management system, which underpinned the intended benefits and  ransformation. These avoidable mistakes wasted £98 million of taxpayers’ money and left the tagging service reliant on legacy systems that needed urgent remedial action, costing a further £9.8 million."

### The current situation
The service is currently outsourced and delivered as a set of managed service offerings by external partners with significant input from MoJ EM. The contracts with external partners expire in January 2024 and the work needed to go to market is already well advanced. The transition to the new contractual arrangements is planned to begin mid-2023 in readiness for the anticipated go-live on 1st February 2024. Work has begun on a new project: "EM Future Service", which covers re-procurement of Electronic Monitoring from 2024 onwards, as well as the future strategy and shape of the programme.

Made Tech have been selected as the Digital Delivery Partner to collaborate with both current and future Electronic Monitoring providers and support EM through this critical period of change to:
- assure the performance, resilience, and security of the current providers’ systems to ensure they continue to meet the needs of the service until they can be decommissioned in 2024
- support the implementation of the new Future Service contracts and the transition into service, ensuring that service continuity is maintained
- actively contribute to decommissioning the current providers’ systems once the transition to the new arrangements is complete, including provision of support to the data migration process
- develop and implement an assurance regime to ensure that systems and data are well managed, meet user needs, and appropriately secured by Future Service providers in-line with MoJ standards
- build, implement and support digital products that enable the realisation of improvements within the Future Service contracts and are aligned with the MoJ’s wider Digital Strategy
- support the development of appropriate documentation to support and build knowledge across MOJ staff to support contract management of the Future Service
