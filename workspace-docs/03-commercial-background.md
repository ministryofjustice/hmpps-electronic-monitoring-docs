## Commercial background
- Roughly 6 suppliers across 9 contracts covers the end to end service. Contracts have built up over time driven by high profile failures. For example Capita built a case management system (Gemini) and failed to deliver it, so EM brought in G4S to fill the gap, this has resulted in - both companies working to provide the digital services that support EM. They don't work well together and have a rocky relationship with EM as the "Authority" of the service.
- The 3 tag suppliers were added over the years through expansion contracts (G4S, Scramnet, Buddy - home office immigration monitoring) these companies also have their own systems which all feed into Capita.
- AirBus deliver aquistive crime tracking which links into the Home Office.

### EM and suppliers
EM had a tendancy as an authority to interfer, that has led to suppliers leaning on the EM Authority to drive changes and improvements as well as fixing issues.
This has been identified as a key improvement action that EM want to change for the future - The EM Authority wants to take on a more of an assurance role that steers suppliers to meet digital outcomes putting more responsibilities onto suppliers.
